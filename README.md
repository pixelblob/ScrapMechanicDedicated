Thank you <a href="https://github.com/QuestionableM)https://github.com/QuestionableM">QuestionableM</a> for the SM-GraphicsModifier that was used to lower the games gpu usage by removing the unneeded texture rendering aswell as his <a href="https://github.com/QuestionableM/SM-DLL-Injector">SM-DLL-Injector</a> that was used to inject SM-GraphicsModifier.


Various game files are provided in the `GameFiles` folder, this folder only contains files related to the game running in a headless sense, none of the texture files that are needed to play the game are included.
